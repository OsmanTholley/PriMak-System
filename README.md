Coordinate and track inmates' participation in rehabilitation programs, educational courses, vocational training, and counseling services.
Develop and implement individualized treatment plans to address the specific needs and risk factors of each inmate.
Facilitate the reintegration of inmates into the community upon release, including transitional housing, job placement, and social support services.

Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in the correctional system.
Provide data-driven insights to policymakers and decision-makers to inform policy changes and resource allocation.
